# TheBiGFatDistortion-Guitar-effector-
We designed a negative feedback amplifier circuit consisting of two transistors. We will distribute Gerber data (Zip for JLC) that can be ordered from JLC PCB.トランジスタ２石で構成した負帰還増幅回路を設計しました。JLC PCBで発注できるガーバーデータ(Zip for JLC)を配布します。

For some reason, IC designs are the mainstream for distortion circuits. I don't know why, but I thought that it could be built with transistors using a very simple design as shown in the attached image, so I created an organic distortion circuit.

The low gain switch reduces the amount of negative feedback, allowing you to enjoy a truly smooth tone. One of the things I was particular about was creating a channel that expressed a slight warmth with the frequency characteristics added at this time.

I wanted to get the VR from Tokyo Cosmos, but due to the relationship between constants and curves, I ended up assembling it from a total of three manufacturers. The bias adjustment trim is also from Tokyo Cosmos!
If the volume decreases quickly when you lower the Vol knob, adjust it with Trim. It should be at the position where the loudest volume is produced, approximately 40-60%, but due to individual differences in transistors, fine adjustment may be necessary.

Jack, DC terminal, 3PDT, chassis... It took me quite a while to find what I liked. The grip on the sole of the foot is made of a special material called Hanenite, which is very nice.

We have adopted a unique mechanism for wiring. I tried to minimize the noise by using FTP (Foiled Twisted Pair) cables, and this was a really great noise reduction.
In addition to the twisted pair cable treatment, the idea of ​​using metal foil for noise reduction and butyl rubber tape with a fused outer shell was a complete success.

Please use the center negative DC9V power supply used for general guitar effectors. An isolated type or rechargeable type is useful for noise suppression.It is not designed with low voltage protection, so if you are concerned, please insert a 9V three-terminal regulator or a 9.1V Zener diode in front of the LED anode.

Tr1 and Tr2 should work if they have a complementary relationship, but E, B, and C start from terminal 1.

No compromises have been made in the application of dozens of layers of lacquer pigments. It is no exaggeration to say that the texture created by the exquisite unevenness created by the many layers is a result of craftsmanship...
